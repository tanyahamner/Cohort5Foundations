There are a few menus: 2 main ones:

A Manager Menu and a User Menu

To access either menu the team member has to log in first. If they do not already have an account a manager will need to create their account.

Once they have logged in it will register if they are either user or manager and take them one of those menus.

Thank you for your interest in joining the ranch. We take pride here on the ranch to make sure everyone has grit and can work on the web while working livestock.

As a Manager you already have your own user log in information and will have access to everything.

Your user login is: john@devpipeline.com

Your password is: 1234

Your user id: 4

To first log in you need to run the Welcome Menu.

Select Manager and Log In.

Then if you would like you can change your own password by selecting 2 (Edit User Profile), enter your user id, and select P.

Users that work here are only allowed to update their basic information, change their password, and see their scores on their assessments. When they go to the menu they select 2 and log in and they can see what options they have.

As a manager you will not be able to see anybodyâ€™s password so if they forget their password you can change it for them.

There are 15 competencies that the users take a test on. There are 4 assessments that break up all 15 competencies. The user gets scored 1-4 on their assessment test about their knowledge. A few users have completed all 4 assessments but there are a few users behind.
