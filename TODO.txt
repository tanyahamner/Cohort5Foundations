-Done- A database schema design document, like an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). These are the same diagrams we have been creating in  
       class that show the entities, their columns with their respective data types and keys and constraints (PRIMARY, FOREIGN, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, DEFAULT), and any relationships between tables.

A working application that meets the requirements in this document. It should be a working console application (terminal app).

A CSV file that can be imported into the application to add assessment results

A database file (SQLite) that contains the data from your executions of the application. You should have plenty of test data in here for testing your application as well as for grading.

Instructions on how to use your application. This doesn't have to be fancy, just a text or markdown document (README.md) that describes how your application should work.

A GitHub repository that you can push all of the above code and documentation to. This is how you will turn in the assignment.
